connect VS code to Code commit repository :
To connect VS code to Code commit repository, you need to follow these steps: 

Create an AWS CodeCommit repository on AWS and give it a name and description.â€¯You can do this by going to AWS management console > Service > Developer Tools >CodeCommit and clicking on Create Repository1. 

Create a user on AWS with the AWSCodeCommitPowerUser policy attached. You can do this by going to services > Identity and Access Management (IAM) > Users and clicking on Add user.â€¯Then, enter a user name, password, and select the AWSCodeCommitPowerUser policy from the Attach existing policies directly tab1. 

Generate HTTPS Git credentials for the user and download the credential file. You can do this by going to services > Identity and Access Management (IAM) > Users and clicking on the user you created.â€¯Then, click on the Security Credentials tab and click on Generate Credentials button under HTTPS Git credentials for AWS CodeCommit section1. 

Open VS code and configure Git with your user name and email. You can do this by opening VS code and clicking on Terminal > New Terminal and entering the following commands: 

git config --global user.name "Your Name"git config --global user.email test@example.com 
 

Copy 

Initialize a local Git repository in VS code.â€¯You can do this by typingâ€¯git initâ€¯in the terminal window1. 

Add the files to the local Git repository.â€¯You can do this by typingâ€¯git add --allâ€¯in the terminal window1. 

Commit the files to the local Git repository.â€¯You can do this by typingâ€¯git commit -m "<commit comment>"â€¯in the terminal window12. 

Connect the local Git repository to the AWS CodeCommit repository. You can do this by typingâ€¯git remote add origin <Link to AWS CodeCommit Repo>â€¯in the terminal window. You can find the link to the AWS CodeCommit repo by going to AWS management console > Service > Developer Tools >CodeCommit and clicking on the repo you created.â€¯Then, copy the HTTPS clone URL from the Clone URL section1. 

Push the files from the local Git repository to the AWS CodeCommit repository.â€¯You can do this by typingâ€¯git push -u origin masterâ€¯in the terminal window12. You will be prompted to enter your user name and password from the credential file you downloaded earlier.
